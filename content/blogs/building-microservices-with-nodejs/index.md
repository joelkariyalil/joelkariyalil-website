# Building Scalable Microservices with Node.js

A comprehensive guide to building scalable microservices using Node.js, including best practices for deployment and monitoring.

## What You'll Learn

- Microservices architecture principles
- Service discovery and configuration
- Inter-service communication
- Containerization with Docker
- Orchestration with Kubernetes
- Monitoring and logging
- Error handling and resilience

## Setting Up the Development Environment

First, let's set up our development environment:

```bash
# Create project structure
mkdir microservices-demo
cd microservices-demo

# Initialize services
for service in auth users products orders; do
  mkdir $service
  cd $service
  npm init -y
  npm install express typescript @types/node
  cd ..
done
```

## Service Communication

Here's how services communicate using HTTP/REST:

```typescript
// users-service/src/index.ts
import express from 'express';
import axios from 'axios';

const app = express();

app.get('/users/:id/orders', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const orders = await axios.get(
      `${process.env.ORDERS_SERVICE}/orders/user/${req.params.id}`
    );
    res.json(orders.data);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch orders' });
  }
});
```

## Docker Configuration

Each service needs its own Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Kubernetes Deployment

Deploy services using Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: users-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: users-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: users-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: users-service
        image: users-service:1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep services small and focused
2. Use async communication when possible
3. Implement circuit breakers
4. Monitor service health
5. Use proper logging
6. Implement proper error handling

## Conclusion

Building microservices requires careful planning and understanding of distributed systems. Start small, focus on service boundaries, and gradually expand your architecture as needed.
