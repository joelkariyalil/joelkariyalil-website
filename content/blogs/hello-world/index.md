# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences with you all. This blog will be focused on software development, technology, and my personal journey in the tech world.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:
- Software development best practices
- New technologies I'm learning
- Project walkthroughs and tutorials
- Personal experiences and lessons learned

## Code Examples

Here's a simple example of a React component:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
