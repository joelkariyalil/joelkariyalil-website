# Image Based Classifier

A real-time image classification system that runs entirely in the browser using TensorFlow.js and MobileNet pre-trained model.

## Features

- Real-time image classification from webcam
- Support for image upload and classification
- Mobile-friendly interface
- No server-side processing required
- Custom model training capabilities
- Performance optimization for mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- TensorFlow.js
- React
- TypeScript
- WebGL acceleration
- Progressive Web App (PWA)

## Implementation Details

The application uses TensorFlow.js to load a pre-trained MobileNet model and perform real-time image classification. The model is optimized for mobile devices and can run efficiently in the browser.

### Key Components
